# Context

* Run type (Casual/Normal/Hardcore/Aftercore):
* Challenge Path (Standard/Path Name/None):

# Expected/Desired Behavior

Please describe the behavior you are expecting. If the bug or feature involves a particular challenge path, item, quest, etc, please state that.

# Current Behavior

What is the current behavior?

# Failure Information (for bugs)

Please help provide information about the failure if this is a bug.

If you are submitting a bug report we really need the KoLMafia session log attached to the issue or it will be harder to help you. If possible please set `printStackOnAbort` in KoLMafia preferences or run `set printStackOnAbort=true` in the Graphical CLI tab. ASScend should set this to true by default when you run it, but please be sure its set. This will provide extra information when an abort is triggered which may help identify the problem.

If it is not a bug, please remove the rest of this template.

## Failure Logs

Please include any relevant log snippets or files here. You should still attach the full KoLMafia session log if possible.
