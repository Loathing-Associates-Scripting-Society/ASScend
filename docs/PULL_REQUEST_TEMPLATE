## How Has This Been Tested?

Testing ASH scripts is tricky and generally involves you doing multiple runs with a change to see how it performs. If you did any particular tests, or have particular tests you would like to do but cant (e.g. need to test with an expensive item you dont have access to) please mention that here. Relevant Mafia session logs may also be helpful.
